## Abstract <a name="Abstract "></a>
This project is a branch of the [COVID-19-By-Country](https://github.com/OQ2000/COVID-19-By-Country) repository.
One of the suggested ideas for visualising the data that was discussed within our team was ways that the data that we had harvested could be displayed to a user.
On this discussion, a member of my team discussed the idea of having a dashboard, on this idea I decided to see if I could apply my excel knowledge to creating a dashboard inside of excel.

This dashboard concept will be used to create a dashboard to display our COVID-19 WHO data that we have harvested.
This is a prerequisite test.
## Context <a name="Context"></a>
Using a youtube tutorial I will be recreating a dashboard to visualise the data from a company that currently tracks:

|Date Of Sale|Customer Acquisition Type|State|Product|Price|Units Sold|Revenue|Delivery Performance|Return|Customer Satisfaction Rating|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Date|Ad,Organic,Returning|Us State|Product1-5|Currency|Number|Currency|On-Time,Delayed|No,Yes|1(Very Low)-5(Very-High)


The purpose of this project could be that a company may want their data to be understandable for more people as having the data visualised in this way will greatly increase the engagement of a user, if not interacting with the sheet directly but merely from a viewing stand point will engage a viewer much greater.

## Outcome <a name="Outcome"></a>
As outlined in the [Abstract](#Abstract) the purpose of this project was to learn the fundamentals of creating excel visualizations of data.

Below is a screenshot of the final product, although the colours could do with being more complimentary in places and should have more contrast in others, this project outline was to learn the fundamentals of creating appealing excel dashboards and I feel like I know posses the knowledge to create a dashboard on other datasets.
